If you have ever found yourself working on a very large project with multiple microservices, you have most likely found yourself
creating the same boilerplate code over and over again whenever a new (micro) service is needed.

While it is not a huge hassle, copy-pasting files from other services is not *that* efficient. Additionally, it can also be a
rather time-consuming task that is error-prone.

Sloth has been created to address these problems. We are engineers - we are lazy! Why spend 5 minutes doing a task manually,
when there is a library that can do it in mere seconds? All you need to do is install Sloth and define the boilerplate code
once!
